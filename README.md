# my-first-simple-spiders-with-scrapy
this is my first simple scraper that i learned it from scrapy library "https://docs.scrapy.org/en/latest/intro/tutorial.html".
in this project i scrape and extract information that i need and store the information in a json file.
we have 2 different code that you should see and try it.

first make a virtual enviroment and install scrapy with:

pip install scrapy

for run each of this codes you have to get help from shell and write a command like below: 

scrapy runspider <spider_name> -o <json_name>.json ----> scrapy runspider spider1.py -o wikipedia.json

the above command stores the extract data by spider in json file
